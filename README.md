# Build a Copilot app using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure OpenAI Service, Azure App Service and Semantic Kernel

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/cosmosdb-nosql-copilot)

This sample application shows how to build a multi-tenant, multi-user, Generative-AI RAG Pattern application using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL with its new vector database capabilities with Azure OpenAI Service on Azure App Service. This sample shows both using Native SDKs as well as Semantic Kernel integration. The sample provides practical guidance on many concepts you will need to design and build these types of applications.

## Important Security Notice

This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.

## Features

This application demonstrates the following concepts and how to implement them:

- How to build a highly scalable, multi-tenant & user, Generative-AI chat application using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.
- Generating completions and embeddings using Azure OpenAI Service.
- Managing a context window (chat history) for natural conversational interactions with an LLM.
- Manage per-request token consumption and payload sizes for Azure OpenAI Service requests.
- Building a semantic cache using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL vector search for improved performance and cost.
- Using the Semantic Kernel SDK for completion and embeddings generation.
- Implementing RAG Pattern using vector search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL on custom data to augment generated responses from an LLM.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription.
- Subscription access to Azure OpenAI service. Start here to [Request Access to Azure OpenAI Service](https://aka.ms/oaiapply). If you have access, see below for ensuring enough quota to deploy.
- Enroll in the [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL Vector Search Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search#enroll-in-the-vector-search-preview-feature) (See below for more details)
- .NET 8 or above. [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd-install)
- Visual Studio, VS Code, GitHub Codespaces or another editor to edit or view the source for this sample.

  #### Vector search Preview details

  This lab utilizes a preview feature, **Vector search for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** which requires preview feature registration. Follow the below steps to register. You must be enrolled before you can deploy this solution:

  1. Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL resource page.
  1. Select the "Features" pane under the "Settings" menu item.
  1. Select for “Vector Search in Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL”.
  1. Read the description to confirm you want to enroll in the preview.
  1. Select "Enable" to enroll in the Vector Search preview.

  #### Checking Azure OpenAI quota limits

  For this sample to deploy successfully, there needs to be enough Azure OpenAI quota for the models used by this sample within your subscription. This sample deploys a new Azure OpenAI account with two models, **gpt-4o with 10K tokens** per minute and **text-3-large with 5k tokens** per minute. For more information on how to check your model quota and change it, see [Manage Azure OpenAI Service Quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/quota)

  #### Azure Subscription Permission Requirements

  This solution deploys [user-assigned managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and defines then applies Azure Cosmos DB RBAC permissions to this identity. At a minimum you will need the following Azure RBAC roles assigned to your identity in your Azure subscription or [Subscription Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#owner) access which will give you both of the following.

  - [Manged Identity Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/identity#managed-identity-contributor)
  - [DocumentDB Account Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/databases#documentdb-account-contributor)

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this template virtually by using GitHub Codespaces. The button will open a web-based VS Code instance in your browser:

1. Open the template (this may take several minutes):

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/AzureCosmosDB/cosmosdb-nosql-copilot)

2. Open a terminal window
3. Continue with the [deploying steps](#deployment)

### Local Environment

If you're not using one of the above options for opening the project, then you'll need to:

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/downloads/)
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    * [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
    * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
        * If using VS Code, install the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)

2. Download the project code:

    ```shell
    azd init -t cosmosdb-nosql-copilot
    ```

3. If you're using Visual Studio, open the src/cosmos-copilot.sln solution file. If you're using VS Code, open the src folder.

7. Continue with the [deploying steps](#deployment).

### VS Code Dev Containers

A related option is VS Code Dev Containers, which will open the project in your local VS Code using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <UserSecretsId>your-guid-here</UserSecretsId>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Locate the secrets.json file and open with a text editor.

- Windows: `C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<UserSecretsId>\secrets.json`
- macOS/Linux: `~/.microsoft/usersecrets/<UserSecretsId>/secrets.json`
